## Starbucks Term Research Project:  
### A Step-by-Step Student e-Guide


**This e-Guide is anonymous and designed so peer journal reviewers can view the content we deploy to students at the beginning of each semester.**

This e-Guide conforms with the Case Study **_and_** Teaching Notes manuscripts.

Although this e-Guide is illustrative in nature and a separate document that is not intended to undergo its own peer review, we invite peer reviewers to comment on its presentation and offer suggestions for improvement.


On the left-hand sidebar, there is a Table of Contents that divides each deliverable into an easy-to-understand presentation.

Check out the content!
