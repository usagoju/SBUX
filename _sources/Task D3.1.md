# Task D3.1

## Continue to collaborate and select a new group leader. 
### Select at least two different Starbucks stores, visit each for at least one hour, and identify and evaluate one store-level risk factor of interest that could come true. If visiting physical stores is not viable, an alternative option is presented.

Students continue collaborating within their assigned groups. Students elect a new group leader to centralize group communications and peer reviews. Students should reassess whether their communication system is working adequately and consider whether a change is needed. The group leader should communicate and ensure that all group members know which Starbucks locations each group member has selected. The assigned leader in each group is required to submit a weekly one-paragraph summary of the communication setup and group interactions and raise any concerns students may have.

Visiting Starbucks locations is an important part of the project because it is the most significant point in transforming abstract accounting information into real concrete experiences. Store selection is important. Starbucks leases its logo to cafes inside schools, Barnes and Noble, supermarkets, or similar locations. Because those locations may display the sign that they are ‚ÄúProudly Serving Starbucks Coffee,‚Äù it does not mean these operations are corporate-owned Starbucks stores. A tip that stores may be leasing the rights to display a Starbucks logo is the inability to use the Starbucks app when attempting to use rewards or possibly a Starbucks gift card. 

Many students encounter challenges understanding risks they can observe at the store level, which could affect the financial statements, especially if they are not discussed in the Form 10-K. Below are some helpful suggestions while making observations. It is not an exhaustive list, but just suggestions to help answer this deliverable's required short essay questions. Students should be creative in their own observations of risks.  

- How do employees perform their tasks (a cashier taking orders and how the process is done, or inventory appears to be wasted or unaccounted for)?  
- Do cashiers appear to be able to make unrecorded sales? This could happen by someone placing a small tip in the tip bucket and being given an item without paying full price for it. 
- Could baristas pass beverages over the counter for free? Does there appear to be an accounting for courtesy or replacement beverages?
- Does the manager appear to be onsite, responsible, and engaged with its employees?
- Can inventory be stolen? Is there a specific category or single item more susceptible than others?  
- Are security cameras strategically placed, and what are their purposes?
- How is garbage disposed? How does garbage connect to accounting?
- Can employees/family members/friends consume inventory without paying for it?
- What is the quality of signage, lighting, seating arrangements, age and quality of fixed assets, parking issues, drive-up issues, etc.?
- To what extent could employees engage in collusion? Which employees are most/least likely to be successful in colluding?

#### Option: Virtual Visitation

A virtual visitation option is presented for students who cannot physically visit a Starbucks store location. Students should consult with their instructor to discuss the virtual option. A store-level analysis requires one to observe store-level operations. Although a virtual option is presented for instructors to consider, if possible, physical visitation should be the primary choice.  

A virtual field visit has weaknesses, such as not allowing one to be inside a location and experience the action, but it has strengths in that it allows for essential data to be collected. Several consumer feedback portals, such as Yelp, have been populating data on the Internet. 

Yelp allows consumers to post check-ins, photos, reviews, and tips about businesses they have visited. Other notable platforms include Google, Facebook, Urban Spoon, and Glassdoor. Each option offers valuable information that could be used in this deliverable. For example, employees can post reviews on their work environment and suggestions to management on the Glassdoor platform. Consumers are encouraged to post photos of the atmosphere and provide feedback on accommodations, pricing, and how these aspects of the business compare to those of local competitors. 

These sites allow consumers to research business locations before making a visit. Our project is relevant because businesses have utilized the information gathered on these sites to make operational changes, which affect accounting business decisions. By analyzing feedback portals, data can reach far beyond what could be retrieved from a limited physical field visit. For instance, reviews that highlight the store‚Äôs procedures during a time of a high visitor rate could provide information that a physical field visit with a low visitor rate would not.

Whether students are physically or virtually conducting visitations, here are helpful videos to understand Starbucks store level operations.
