# Introduction

Much of accounting can be viewed as somewhat abstract or theoretical in nature. The ideas taught are sometimes challenging to grasp because they do not possess physical substance. Students are exposed to many abstract, theoretical accounting concepts in beginning accounting classes. Some students fare well in this abstract learning environment, but many do not. Textbooks teach students how to apply these abstract concepts by completing homework problems of hypothetical businesses and case studies of real companies. As laudable as that is, it does not give exposure to real, concrete experiences dealing with accounting issues. 

A prevailing problem in accounting curricula is a lack of exposure dealing with real-life businesses in a high-level active or experiential learning environment. Compared to other fields (e.g., education and the physical sciences), accounting offers limited field experiences in undergraduate and graduate study courses. Internships and VITA programs are well-known among them. However, most accounting classes do not offer opportunities to go into the field and try to incorporate what students are learning in class into what businesses are physically doing. Just reading the text and doing exercises has its limitations. Accounting students seemingly get stuck in the abstract, theoretical world. 

This project attempts to connect abstract, theoretical textbook learning with a practical term project. This approach allows students to transform their learning from the abstract world to the real, concrete world by producing experiences that allow them to absorb information and analyze a business more thoroughly.   

Using the Starbucks Corporation, a well-known, easily accessible, publicly traded business entity, students will come to understand a business and its environment, assess risk to determine possible areas of concern to users of financial information, analyze results, and make recommendations to internal and external users of information. Once students understand accounting theory and its application, they will take the first steps to understand information and make better, informed business decisions across various industries.   

The instructions contained in this document are specifically written to allow a student to connect the theoretical discussion found in many accounting textbooks to practical, real-world, concrete experience driving toward a rich learning experience. It is hoped that students will take the opportunity to engage in this project as an alternative path to understanding abstract accounting concepts and dealing with real live businesses that impact the communities where students may live/work. 

Approximately 1,000 students in past classes have experienced this term project. Students have overwhelmingly expressed feelings of accomplishment and how much they learned about accounting in a way they have never experienced in past classes. The authors are confident that future students will enjoy the experience. If any errors or areas that need more clarity are noted, please bring them to the attention of the authors.  This document has undergone numerous edits based on many suggestions from past students who have successfully completed the project. The authors encourage students and instructors to give suggestions as well.
The authors wish you good luck with this term project and hope it will enrich your learning experience!
