    "In addition to the instructions outlined in the Step-by-Step Guide, to enhance your understanding of the business entity and its environment, students should use all resources available to them, including, but not limited to, the library (specifically the business librarian), Internet, professional opinions and interpretations, company published information, brokerage house information, etc. Students should think about creative ways to extract and understand information.
