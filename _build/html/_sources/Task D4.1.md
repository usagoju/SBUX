# Task D4.1

## Continue to collaborate and select a new group leader. 
### As a group, students showcase their unique perspectives by working together to agree on presentation content, draft a storyboard, rehearse, and present it.

For groups of less than four students, one must act as a group leader to ensure the presentation is cohesive. Students should select a group member who is confident in group organizational skills. Communication among the group will be critical to ensuring work is compiled, integrated, rehearsed, and presented in a timely manner. The assigned leader in each group is required to submit a weekly one-paragraph summary of the communication setup and group interactions and raise any concerns students may have.
Each group member reviews the results of all three deliverables submitted by other group members and the minutes of all group meetings. This process is critical to integrating each member‚Äôs work products and formulating a cohesive story about their findings. The presentation should focus on how management portrays that information and how risks can be mitigated.

If each group member carefully followed all prior tasks and was engaged in the peer review process during each project deliverable, organizing the content for deliverable four should be straightforward. Once the group agrees on the content, draft a storyboard to convey it in a concise presentation, which can simply be a series of empty slides in a PowerPoint that students populate with their ideas.

Perhaps a simple and effective demonstration of how to present a storyboard is by Leila Gharani, a prominent YouTuber who specializes in Microsoft product demonstrations. She presents information clearly and concisely. She is not the only person who specializes in this space, but she is well known with over 2.6 million subscribers. She has produced a video that covers screen recording and recording a slideshow: [How to Easily Make a Video üéûÔ∏è in PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hisnhKK94nI) (Slideshow & Screen Recording). Alternatively, students may want to search the internet for other videos to get ideas on how to use Storyboarding. Students are not bound to use this storyboard demonstration. Students are encouraged to pursue other methods if they are easier or workable.

Each student should contribute an approximately 90-120 second sound bite explaining their portion of the group‚Äôs findings to the overall slideshow. The whole slideshow presentation should be approximately six to seven minutes long. There is no minimum or maximum amount of slides. Just fall within the time limit.
We cannot stress enough to students how important it is to rehearse presentations so mistakes are minimized during the recording and have proper timing. Sometimes, group members may not be able to speak English or may have physical challenges speaking clearly. If a group member cannot speak, someone else may present on that person‚Äôs behalf.
