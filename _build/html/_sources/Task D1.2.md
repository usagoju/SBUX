# Task D1.2

## Use Excel to analyze financial statement information

Students are required to visit the Starbucks website to obtain and gather the Income Statement (Consolidated Statement of Earnings), Balance Sheet (Consolidated Balance Sheets) and, and Cash Flow Statements (Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) for the past three years, which are contained in Starbucks Form 10-K filings. A Form 10-K is an annual report that is filed with the [Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/).  

To locate these filings, navigate to the [Starbucks homepage](https://www.starbucks.com/), scroll to the bottom of the homepage, and you will see a section labeled “About Us” in the lower left-hand corner. Under that section, one will see a link to “[Investor Relations](https://investor.starbucks.com/ir-home/default.aspx)” (Figure 2, Panel A). That link will direct you to the Starbucks Investor Relations page (Figure 2, Panel B). In the menu across the top of the page, you will see a link labeled “Financials”. When one hovers the mouse over it, a Financial Data pop-up screen will appear (Figure 2, Panel C).  Select “[Annual Reports](https://investor.starbucks.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx)” underneath the words “Financial Data”.  The latest annual report will appear (Figure 2, Panel D). Scrolling all the way down on this webpage, you will see Annual Reports dated back to 1999. You will select the "FY23 Annual Report" (Figure 2, Panel E) (Note: students should start with the latest published year available). When one clicks on this link, one will see a PDF version of the FY23 Annual Report, which contains the FY23 10-K . To find prior years’ financial data, students can look at past SEC filings directly in the Starbucks webpages. On the Starbucks [Annual Report Homepage](https://investor.starbucks.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx), under Financials, there is a link to [SEC Filings](https://investor.starbucks.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx) (Figure 2, Panel F).

Once the Annual Report has been accessed, scroll down to the Table of Contents. Click on Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The first financial statement that you will see is Starbucks Corporation Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Income Statement). Note that it covers a three year period. Scroll down further and you will see two other financial statements that are needed for the analysis: Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Cash Flow Statements), as well as the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (as shown in Figure 2, Panels G-J).

**What to do once students have accessed the financial statements.**

Once the financial statements of interest are accessed, students are to create a master spreadsheet in Excel that will display at least three years of data (or whatever your instructor requires ) for the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Income Statement – IS), Consolidated Balance Sheets (BS) and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (Cash Flow Statements - CF). To accomplish this task, create three blank worksheets (in the same Excel file) and label each sheet IS, BS, and CF. In column A for each worksheet, transfer the account names exactly as you find them in the financial statements. If students encounter account names in one year and not the next, students will still write all of them in column A. Students must physically retype the information, not simply copying and pasting.
 
In columns B, C and D, fill in the figures found on each financial statement for each of the years. Note that the 10-K financial information is presented from the latest to earlier years.  For analytical purposes, reverse them and present the information from the earliest year to the later years. In the header row, label column B: 2019, column C: 2020, column D: 2021 (Students will use the latest three years available). Color coding and contrasting headers with bold lettering for a more visually professional appearance is acceptable and encouraged. The immediate goal in this task is to get the formatting down and set up the spreadsheets as best as possible.
The purpose of physically transferring information is to allow students to become much more familiar with the account names and corresponding figures and achieve the objective of organizing, structuring, and presenting complex financial data for analysis.
