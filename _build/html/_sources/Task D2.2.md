# Task D2.2

## Read selected parts of the Starbucks 10-K, identify and evaluate a risk factor of interest that could come true, and then answer three related short essay questions.

To meet deliverable two, students conduct a more in-depth reading of Form 10-K. This task requires a lot of reading, and students should allocate at least a few hours to read the required information. Past groups have asked to elect a representative to read everything and summarize their understanding with other group members. However, that is not the approach to be used. All group members should individually engage in reading all the required parts of the Form 10-Ks. To appreciate risks a company may confront and how they may affect financial statements, students must be well informed with Form 10-K, Part 1, Items 1, 1A, 2, 3, and Part II, Items 7 and 8. Part I contains a discussion on the business model, risk factors, properties, and legal issues. Part II contains Management’s Discussion and Analyses (MD&A), the financial statements, and the notes to the financial statements. All these statements are referred to holistically as _management assertions_. Parts I and II contain discussions on many types of risk that the business may be exposed to. Students should read through all these areas. Once students have read through Parts I and II, they will be well informed about information presented on financial statements.  

The following elaborates on each area students are to read identified in the paragraph above.

**Part 1, Item 1.  Business**
In this discussion, Starbucks discusses its business model, how it segments it financial information, and how it categorizes and earns revenue.

**Part 1, Item 1A.  Risk Factors**
In this discussion, Starbucks discusses the material risks that it has identified and decided to share with the public. Although a public company such as Starbucks must disclose risks. The Security and Exchange Commission mandates a separate section to discuss risks. However, risks can also be identified by reading other areas of the Annual Report and observations in its store operations. In 2024, Starbucks identified 24 material risks. For purposes of this project, we refer to risks disclosed in the Form 10-K and “company level risks”.

**Part 1, Item 2.  Properties**
In this discussion, Starbucks discloses select properties that it owns, providing locations, sizes, and purposes. This information can help a reader understand what properties may be at risk and how Starbuck’s operations could be affected if something were to happen to one or more properties.

**Part 1, Item 2.  Legal Proceedings**
Starbucks elaborates on their legal proceedings in Item 15, Commitments and Contingencies. Many companies do the same.

**Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analyses** 
This discussion is management’s interpretation of the results of its operations.  An important point to be made is that this is management’s interpretations. Management of companies tend to highlight the positive and suppress the negative. They tend to guide the discussion the way they want. In this section, you may get a better idea what risks management may find important and those they may try to minimize. From a student perspective, it is filled with good information that may help you further understand the trends in the horizontal, vertical, and ratio analysis that you performed. 

**Part II, Item 8.  Index to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**
In this discussion, management further clarifies information contained in the income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows. For purposes of this project, focus on notes 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 15. In Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, only focus on the discussion about the business, estimates, cash and cash equivalents, Receivables, net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Property, Plant and Equipment, and Revenue Recognition.  Note 5 discusses inventories in detail and will give students insight on where Starbucks obtains inventory and how it categorizes it. Note 7 contains Supplemental Balance Sheet Information, which discusses Property, Plant and Equipment, and Accrued Liabilities. Note 9 discusses Debt (Liabilities). In this section, Starbucks discusses in a lot of detail how it funds its operations. Students may want to read it just to see the complexities of accounting for debt and the risks that Starbucks takes to pay back financing agreements. Item 15 discusses Commitments and Contingencies. In this section, the legal proceedings are most important, which is a gold mine for identifying potential risks. 

### Short Essay Questions

Once students have read through the Form 10-K selected readings, answer three short essay questions D2.2.a, D2.2.b and D2.2.c.  

**Short Essay Question D2.2.a: From reading Starbucks disclosed risks, how do risk factors have a potentially adverse effect on financial statements?**

:::{admonition} Guidance
:class: tip

Choose one risk in Starbucks latest published 10-K. Assume the risk that you chose came true. Evaluate and analyze any possible adverse effects on the financial statements. The answer should be written in three paragraphs. The first paragraph should evaluate the effect on the income statement, the second paragraph should evaluate the effect on the balance sheet, and the third paragraph should evaluate the effect on the cash flow statement. Students must support their answer with hypothetical sample calculations. The discussion should be primarily accounting-oriented (as opposed to Marketing or Management).

**Short Essay Question D2.2.b: Identify and discuss any possible misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent information between the student’s analysis and management assertions.**

:::{admonition} Guidance
:class: tip

Students further analyze the risk chosen in question D2.2.a by identifying any possible misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent information between the student’s analysis and management assertions. Focusing more on accounting terminology, students must write one to two paragraphs of at least 200 words explaining why any specific quotes or narrative management discloses are misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent of information. If a student believes there is absent information, speculate where it should be disclosed and why. A simple statement that there is no misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent information without explaining why is unacceptable. 

There is always some information that one can consider misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent. This is part of critical thinking and logical reasoning skill-building. A helpful hint to uncover it is to read how the chosen risk was disclosed in its latest published 10-K and compare it to the prior years, year by year. For example, how did management handle disclosures of a possible pandemic or other potentially worldwide negative event before 2021? Was Starbucks' narrative consistent from 2018 to 2019, 2019 to 2020, and 2020 to 2021? The short answer is no. Students should interpret those differences in narratives as misleading, inconsistent, contradictory, or absent information.

**Short Essay Question D2.2.c: In the risk scenario described below, discuss how some of the financial ratios highlighted in deliverable one would be affected.**

In the 2021 Form 10-K, Starbucks discloses a risk that states, “Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.”  

:::{admonition} Guidance
:class: tip

A supply chain disruption of coffee beans emerges because of drought in Brazil. This happened and was reported in the Washington Post (Yang, 2014). Students should ask themselves “What are coffee beans to Starbucks?” It is inventory. The inventory sold is reported as the Cost of Sales on the income statement. On the balance sheet, existing coffee beans in Starbucks' possession are reported as inventory. On the cash flow statement, inventory changes are related to cash flows from operating activities. To examine the potential overall effects on the financial statements, students may examine ratios that contain Cost of Sales or inventory in its numerator or denominator.
