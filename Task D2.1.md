# Task D2.1

## Continue to Collaborate with Group Members

Students will continue collaborating within their assigned groups to complete this deliverable, but the work product will be graded individually.  Students elect a new group leader to centralize group communications and peer reviews. Students should reassess if their communication system is working adequately and consider a change, if needed. The assigned leader in each group is required to submit a weekly one-paragraph summary of the communication setup and group interactions and raise any concerns students may have.
